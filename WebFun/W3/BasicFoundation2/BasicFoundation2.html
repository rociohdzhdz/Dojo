    <h1>Basic Foundation 2</h1>
    <h3> Given an array write a function that changes all positive numbers to the string "big"</h3>
    <h3>Create a function that takes in an array of numbers, the function should print the lowest value in the array and
        return the highest value in the array</h3>
    <h3>Build a function that takes in an array of numbers. The function should print the second-to-last value in the
        array,
        and return the first odd value in the array.</h3>
    <h3>Given an array (similar to saying 'takes in an array'), create a function that returns a new array where each
        value in the original array has been doubled. Calling double([1,2,3]) should return [2,4,6] without changing the
        original array.</h3>
    <h3>Given an array of numbers, create a function to replace the last value with the number of positive values found
        in the array. Example, countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes the original array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it.</h3>
    <h3>Create a function that accepts an array. Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That's
        odd!". Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "Even more so!".</h3>
    <h3>Given an array of numbers arr, add 1 to every other element, specifically those whose index is odd (arr[1],
        arr[3], arr[5], etc). Afterward, console.log each array value and return arr.</h3>
    <h3>You are passed an array (similar to saying 'takes in an array' or 'given an array') containing strings. Working
        within that same array, replace each string with a number - the length of the string at the previous array index
        - and return the array. For example, previousLengths(["hello", "dojo", "awesome"]) should return ["hello", 5,
        4]. Hint: Can for loops only go forward?</h3>
    <h3>Build a function that accepts an array. Return a new array with all the values of the original, but add 7 to
        each. Do not alter the original array. Example, addSeven([1,2,3]) should return [8,9,10] in a new array.</h3>
    <h3>Given an array, write a function that reverses its values, in-place. Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns the
        same array, but now contains values reversed like so... [2,4,6,1,3]. Do this without creating an empty temporary
        array. (Hint: you'll need to swap values).</h3>
    <h3>Given an array, create and return a new one containing all the values of the original array, but make them all
        negative (not simply multiplied by -1). Given [1,-3,5], return [-1,-3,-5].</h3>
    <h3>Create a function that accepts an array, and prints "yummy" each time one of the values is equal to "food". If
        no array values are "food", then print "I'm hungry" once.</h3>
    <h3>Given an array, swap the first and last values, third and third-to-last values, etc. Example:
        swapTowardCenter([true,42,"Ada",2,"pizza"]) turns the array into ["pizza", 42, "Ada", 2, true].
        swapTowardCenter([1,2,3,4,5,6]) turns the array into [6,2,4,3,5,1]. No need to return the array this time.</h3>
<h3>Given an array arr and a number num, multiply all values in the array arr by the number num, and return the changed array arr.  For example, scaleArray([1,2,3], 3) should return [3,6,9].</h3>
