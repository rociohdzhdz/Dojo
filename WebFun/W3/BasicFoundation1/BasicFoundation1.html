    <h1>Basic Foundation I</h1>
    <h3>Write a function that returns an array with all the numners from 1 to 255</h3>
    <h3>Write a function that would get the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 1000. You may use a modulus operator
        for this exercise.</h3>
    <h3>Write a function that returns the sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 5000. (e.g. 1+3+5+...+4997+4999)</h3>
    <h3>Write a function that returns the sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 5000. (e.g. 1+3+5+...+4997+4999)</h3>
    <h3>Given an array with multiple values, write a function that returns the maximum number in the array. (e.g. for
        [-3,3,5,7] max is 7)</h3>
    <h3>Given an array with multiple values, write a function that returns the average of the values in the array. (e.g.
        for [1,3,5,7,20] average is 7.2)</h3>
    <h3>Write a function that would return an array of all the odd numbers between 1 to 50. (ex. [1,3,5, .... , 47,49]).
        Hint: Use 'push' method.</h3>
    <h3>Given value of Y, write a function that takes an array and returns the number of values that are greater than Y.
        For example if arr = [1, 3, 5, 7] and Y = 3, your function will return 2. (There are two values in the array
        greater than 3, which are 5, 7).</h3>
    <h3>Given an array with multiple values, write a function that replaces each value in the array with the value
        squared by itself. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will become [1,25,100,4])</h3>
    <h3>Given an array with multiple values, write a function that replaces any negative numbers within the array with
        the value of 0. When the program is done the array should contain no negative values. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will
        become [1,5,10,0])</h3>
    <h3>Given an array with multiple values, write a function that returns a new array that only contains the maximum,
        minimum, and average values of the original array. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will return [10,-2,3.5])</h3>
    <h3>Write a function that will swap the first and last values of any given array. The default minimum length of the
        array is 2. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will become [-2,5,10,1]).</h3>
    <h3>Write a function that takes an array of numbers and replaces any negative values within the array with the string
        'Dojo'. For example if array = [-1,-3,2], your function will return ['Dojo','Dojo',2].</h3>
